# Reading Data

This is where fun starts! Once we have [initialized](README.md#Initialization) fireorm in our application we can start using it!

We'll continue working with the Band's collection we defined in [Core Concept's](CORE_CONCEPTS.md#FireormCollections) section.

## Simple Queries

Fireorm [Repositories](CORE_CONCEPTS.md#FireormRepositories) have the method [findById](Classes/Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#FindById) which you can use to retrieve documents by its... id, duh.

Let's imagine we have a Document in our Bands Collection in firestore with an id `red-hot-chilli-peppers`. To retrieve it we only have to use the handy [findById](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#FindById) method in our repository!

```typescript
import { Collection, GetRepository } from 'fireorm';

@Collection()
class Band {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  formationYear: number;
  genres: Array<string>;
}

const bandRepository = GetRepository(Band);

const band = await bandRepository.findById('red-hot-chilli-peppers');
```

Now the variable band is an instance of our Band model that contains the information about the band! (Red Hot Chilli Peppers is awesome, btw!)

## Complex Queries

Only being able to find documents by id is a bit limiting, that's why fireorm repositories provide a lot of helper functions to ease the filtering of data in queries. These are [whereEqualTo](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#WhereEqualTo), [whereGreaterThan](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#WhereGreaterThan), [whereGreaterOrEqualTha](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#WhereGreaterOrEqualThan), [whereLessThan](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#WhereLessThan), [whereLessOrEqualThan](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#WhereLessOrEqualThan), and [whereArrayContains](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#WhereArrayContains) methods. We can pipe as many methods as we need to perform complex queries, as long as we donâ€™t forget to call the [find](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#Find) method at the end.

```typescript
// Bands formed from 1990 onwards
await bandRepository.whereGreaterOrEqualThan('formationYear', 1990).find();

// Bands whose name is Porcupine Tree
await bandRepository.whereEqualTo('name', 'Porcupine Tree').find();

// Bands formed after 1985 and that play Progressive Rock
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterThan('formationYear', 1985)
  .whereArrayCointain('genres', 'progressive-rock')
  .find();
```

All the \*Where methods have a similar api, where the first parameter is a string that represents the field that we want to search for and the second one is the value that we want to compare to (which can be any [JavaScript primitive type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Primitive_values)). Fireorm also provide an alternative API to make it more type safe; the first parameter can also accept a lamda function where it's first parameter is the type of the model of the repository.

```typescript
// This example is exactly the same than the last one, but using the alternative API.

// Bands formed from 1990 onwards
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterOrEqualThan(band => band.formationYear, 1990)
  .find();

// Bands whose name is Porcupine Tree
await bandRepository.whereEqualTo(band => band.name, 'Porcupine Tree').find();

// Bands formed after 1985 and that play Progressive Rock
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterThan(band => band.formationYear, 1985)
  .whereArrayCointain(band => band.genres, 'progressive-rock')
  .find();
```

## Order By and Limit

Fireorm repositories also provide functions to order documents and limit the quantity of documents that we will retrieve. These are [orderByAscending](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#OrderByAscending), [orderByDescending](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#OrderByDescending) and [limit](Classes/BaseFirestoreRepository.md#Limit). Please be aware that you can only use one orderBy and one limit per query.

```typescript
// Bands formed from 1990 onwards or
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterOrEqualThan(band => band.formationYear, 1990)
  .orderByAscending('name')
  .find();

// Top 10 bands whose formationYear is 1987 in ascending order by formationYear (using the alternative api)
await bandRepository
  .whereEqualTo(band => band.formationYear, 1987)
  .orderByAscending(band => band.formationYear)
  .limit(10)
  .find();

// Top 3 bands formed after 1985 and that play Progressive Rock
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterThan(band => band.formationYear, 1985)
  .whereArrayCointain(band => band.genres, 'progressive-rock')
  .limit(3)
  .find();
```

### Limitations on Complex queries

Please be aware that fireorm cannot circumvent [Firestore query limitations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#query_limitations), we still have to create indexes if we want to create queries that involve more than one field.
